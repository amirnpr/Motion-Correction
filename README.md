This ongoing project aims to correct motion artifacts in PET images by utilizing pairs of PET and CT scans along with neural networks. By leveraging deep learning techniques, the project enhances the accuracy of PET imaging by predicting and correcting motion between PET and CT image pairs. This approach improves the quality of PET scans, making them more reliable for diagnostic and research purposes.
